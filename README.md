# Music 1 Hub

**Music 1 Hub** is an online resource for students and teachers of the Stage 6 Music 1 course. It aims to assist students in developing their aural skills, inline with the HSC Music 1 syllabus.
Currently, version 1 offers a basic rhythmic dictation page, focusing on rhythmic ostinatos in 4/4 time.

## Motivation
**Music 1 Hub** was created by a trained Stage 6 Music 1 teacher, motivated by their frustration for the lack of course structure and limited digital resources for this course.
As adminstrative demands for teachers continue to grow, it is becoming increasingly difficult for teachers to create and maintain their own resources. Thus, **Music 1 Hub** is born! 
**Music 1 Hub** is inspired by Mathspace, an online learning resource for students and teachers of Mathematics.
